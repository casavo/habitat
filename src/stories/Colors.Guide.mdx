    <Body>There are <Inline strong>three main brand colours</Inline> that we use: <Inline strong>orange (primary)</Inline> and <Inline strong>dark green (secondary)</Inline>. </Body>
    <Body>We can also use the <Inline strong>teal</Inline> colour as an <Inline strong>accent colour</Inline>.</Body>

    <H1 display>Color structure</H1>
    <Body>To build the colours up, we’re using several layers in the design system:</Body>
    <Body>
      <ul>
        <li>Primitives, <Inline strong>also known as ‘roots’</Inline>, is an individual design value from our entire catalog of brand colours, e.g. orange-100. This is the most atomic form of colour. We use that to essentially create a list or catalogue of all our existing HEX colours.</li>
        <li>Then is <Inline strong>semantic level</Inline>, or alias tokens. Aliases are essentially nicknames that act as references for primitive design values. They give a more meaningful name to those design tokens, making it easier to understand what they stand for. Semantically, we can differentiate these, too:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Brand level</li>
          <li>Component level</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </Body>
    <Body>More often than not, our components are assigned based on a simple root colour, when that root colour is part of the simple palette of neutrals, for example.</Body>
    <Body>Sometimes, some components can be assigned based not on the root, but the brand alias. This is so in order to maintain a separation between the atomic roots and the brand palette, which might change in the future.</Body>
