<H3>Base unit = 8px</H3>
<Body size="l">
  The spacing system can also be built around a base unit of 8px. This way, itâ€™s quite easy to scale up and down and maintain consistency.
</Body>

{" "}

<H2>Space tokens</H2>
<Body size="l">
  In this case, 8px serves as a basis and is therefore 100%. Its token would then be, for example, Space/100. Every token is a multiple of this base unit, where the number represents the percentage of the base unit. For example, Space/200 is 200% of the size of the base unit, therefore represents 16px.
</Body>

<Table titles={["Token", "JS Token", "Base unit multiplier", "REM", "PX", "Example" ]} />

<H2>Usage & Examples</H2>
<Body size="l">
  Different use cases require different ranges of spacing units to achieve the best outcomes. Here are a few examples:
</Body>

<figure style={{
  marginTop: space[400]
}}>
  <img src="/images/spacing.svg" alt="" loading="lazy" />
</figure>
