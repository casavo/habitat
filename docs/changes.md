# How to propose code changes

> Remember that this is related only to DX changes, for UI/UX changes always [refer to the main flow](../CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-request-changes).

## Bugfixing

Is it a low impact fix or something that you have kwnoledge and time to fix?

**YES** -> [open a PR](CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-submit-code-changes) to submit the change

**NO** -> [open an issue](https://github.com/casavo/habitat/issues/new) detailing the problem as much as possible

## RFC (request for change)

Do you have a clear and opinionated proposal for a change?

**YES** -> [open an issue](https://github.com/casavo/habitat/issues/new) to detail and having conversation about it + (eventually) submit a PR as a reference

**NO** -> ask on slack channel to get feedback and evolve the idea to a clear proposal, then open an issue on the repo
