## Design first

This project is a design driven project, which means we care a lot about the user experience and the aesthetics of our product. We want to create something that is beautiful, functional and easy to use.

Everything in this codebase is a reflection of what has been defined on the related [Figma board](https://www.figma.com/file/0vYcLbHGHFIJ44hFI45WQJ/%F0%9F%9A%80-Habitat?type=design).
